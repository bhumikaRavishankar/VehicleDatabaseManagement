# VehicleDatabaseManagement
In a vehicle organization the management wants to leverage the vehicle management to a systematic way, where a user can add the vehicle details, update the vehicle details, delete the vehicle details and fetch all the details of vehicle. Each vehicle has properties like vid, vname, vprice, vmodel, vcolor. A springboot-based rest api application has been built which implements the below functionalities.
• An api to add vehicle details.
• An api to delete the vehicle details based on vId
• An api to fetch all the details in the database.
• An api to fetch the details of vehicles based on vId.
• An api to fetch the details of vehicle based on the vColor.
• An api to fetch details of vehicles, sorted based on vPrice.
• An api to update the vehicle details based on vId.
• An api to fetch details of vehicles which cost more than 10,00,000.
• An api to fetch details of vehicles sorted based on vPrice (If the vPrice is same, then sorted based on vColor in alphabetic manner).
• A custom exception to handle exceptions where ever required.
• vId is autogenerated.
Postman is used to access the APIs
Database is created in MySQL
